Creating a sproc that outputs JSON in postgresql


Example how to call a sproc in python from postgresql:
http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-python/call-stored-procedures/


Use the sproc in postgresql called "users_json".
We can call it like this in psql:
select users_json()

Code behind it:
create or replace function users_json() returns table(row_to_json json) as $$ begin return query select row_to_json(t) from (select * from users) t; end; $$ language plpgsql;
